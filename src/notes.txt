Since I don't work with class components this task was a struggle at first.

I found it difficult to efficiently access the values necessary to program state changes, I resolved to adding an id attribute to the Swimlane containers the dragula api was working on.
This made it much easier to associate each collumn in the code.

after that I struggled to find a way to update state properly. I tried to decrease the state object depth by one level with no success, then reverted back.
I found that taking the state object and converiting it to a list was very helpful, I just had to remember to update the state the same way the state was initialized.


In the future it may be beneficial to refactor components into functional components and create custom hooks, this would seperate some concerns and work more efficiently should 
client data be fetched from a server/database instead of hard coded. Dragula also has methods to removed elements which could be of use in the future.
